## Financial Performance

### Recent Earnings Reports

FPT's recent earnings reports have provided mixed signals. While the company has exceeded revenue expectations in the second and third quarters of 2023, its earnings per share (EPS) have lagged behind analyst expectations. Specifically, the third quarter of 2023 reported revenues that exceeded forecasts, but the EPS fell short ([Simply Wall St](https://simplywall.st/stocks/vn/software/hose-fpt/fpt-shares/future)). This trend of revenue growth alongside EPS misses may raise concerns among potential investors.

These growth metrics are notably higher than the average market growth rates, indicating that FPT is positioned for robust expansion.
