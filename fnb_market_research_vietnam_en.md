# Research on the Food and Beverage Market in Vietnam

## Introduction

The Food and Beverage (F&B) industry in Vietnam is experiencing a dynamic phase of growth and transformation. As of 2024, the market is projected to expand by 10.92% compared to the previous year, reaching revenues of over VND 655 trillion (US$26.1 billion) ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/vietnam-f-b-industry-in-2024-continues-growth-with-new-trends-2265396.html)). This growth trajectory is underpinned by several key factors, including a burgeoning middle class, increasing urbanization, and evolving consumer preferences.

Vietnam's F&B sector is characterized by its diverse and healthy cuisine, which includes traditional dishes made from rice, vegetables, and fish sauce-based foods. The market has also seen a rapid increase in the number of market players, both local and international, contributing to its vibrant food services sector ([Research in Vietnam](https://www.researchinvietnam.com/insight/the-current-outlook-of-vietnam-fnb-industry)).

Despite the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry has shown remarkable resilience. The reopening of in-person services and the recovery of domestic consumption have been significant drivers of growth. According to [Mordor Intelligence](https://www.viettonkinconsulting.com/fb/the-new-outlook-of-vietnam-food-and-beverage-industry-and-chances-for-investors-post-covid-19/), the F&B industry in Vietnam is expected to grow at an annual rate of 8.65% from 2021 to 2026.

Urbanization is another critical factor contributing to the sector's growth. By 2025, it is predicted that 40% of the Vietnamese population will reside in urban areas, up from around 20% in 1990. Urban dwellers are more likely to dine out and have higher disposable incomes, which translates to greater spending on food and beverages ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-food-and-beverage-industry-market-trends-demographics-consumer-preferences.html/)).

The rise of technology platforms has also played a pivotal role in the industry's recovery and growth. These platforms have enabled businesses to reach potential customers more efficiently, reduce fixed costs, and explore untapped opportunities. As a result, a significant portion of F&B enterprises are expected to recover within six to twelve months ([Viettonkin Consulting](https://www.viettonkinconsulting.com/fb/the-new-outlook-of-vietnam-food-and-beverage-industry-and-chances-for-investors-post-covid-19/)).

In conclusion, the F&B market in Vietnam is poised for substantial growth, driven by strong brand loyalty, strategic expansions, and innovative product offerings. The sector's resilience, coupled with favorable economic and demographic trends, makes it an attractive destination for both local and foreign investors.

## Market Growth and Economic Trends in Vietnam's F&B Sector

### Revenue Growth and Projections

Vietnam's food and beverage (F&B) market has shown remarkable growth and resilience, even amid global economic challenges. In 2023, the F&B industry in Vietnam achieved a growth rate of 11.5%, generating revenues of over US$23.6 billion. The dining market alone contributed US$21.6 billion, marking a 10.9% increase from the previous year ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/prospects-in-vietnam-fb-market-in-2024.html)). Looking ahead, the food service market is projected to grow at an annual compound rate of 9.7%, potentially reaching US$36.86 billion by 2027 ([Research and Markets](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/prospects-in-vietnam-fb-market-in-2024.html)).

In 2024, the value of the F&B market in Vietnam is expected to increase by 10.92% compared to 2023, generating revenues of over VND655 trillion (US$26.1 billion) ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/vietnam-f-b-industry-in-2024-continues-growth-with-new-trends-2265396.html)). This growth is driven by strong brand loyalty, strategic expansions, and innovation in product offerings.

### Economic Environment and Consumer Spending

The stable macroeconomic environment in Vietnam, characterized by relatively low food inflation and positive real GDP growth, has been a significant driver of the F&B sector's growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected strong economic growth potential for Vietnam in the coming years, fueling optimism within the F&B industry ([VNEconomy](https://vneconomy.vn/vietnams-food-and-beverage-industry-poised-for-growth-despite-challenges.htm)).

Vietnamese consumers are demonstrating increased spending on dining out, with the dine-in market alone contributing over VND 538 trillion (US$21.6 billion) to the sector's revenue. Notably, nearly 15% of diners are willing to spend over VND 100,000 (US$4) on a daily dinner, a significant increase from previous years ([VNEconomy](https://vneconomy.vn/vietnams-food-and-beverage-industry-poised-for-growth-despite-challenges.htm)).

### Middle-Class Expansion and Urbanization

The expansion of Vietnam's middle class, which now includes about 44 million citizens, has significantly contributed to the growth of the F&B industry. As this segment grows, their disposable income also helps expand the market ([Research in Vietnam](https://www.researchinvietnam.com/insight/the-current-outlook-of-vietnam-fnb-industry)). By 2030, it is estimated that there will be about 17 million middle-income households in Vietnam, making it the third-largest urban market in terms of consumer numbers and the fifth largest regarding total spending in Southeast Asia ([Viettonkin Consulting](https://www.viettonkinconsulting.com/fb/the-new-outlook-of-vietnam-food-and-beverage-industry-and-chances-for-investors-post-covid-19/)).

Urbanization trends are also positively impacting the sector's growth. It is predicted that 40% of Vietnamese people will live in cities by 2025, up from around 20% in 1990. People living in cities are more likely to eat out and generally have a greater total spend on food and beverages ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-food-and-beverage-industry-market-trends-demographics-consumer-preferences.html/)).

### Health Trends and Consumer Preferences

Increasing health trends are reflected by the increased demand for fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and seafood products. There is also a slow reduction in the consumption of alcohol, partly due to increased health consciousness and a government clampdown on drunk driving. Future tax increases on alcoholic beverages and sugary drinks could further change spending behavior in this sector ([Fitch Solutions](https://store.fitchsolutions.com/food-drink/vietnam-food-drink-report)).

Vietnamese consumers are also showing a growing preference for healthier, organic, and locally-sourced food and beverages. This shift in consumer preferences is driving significant adjustments in product offerings and supply chains ([6Wresearch](https://www.6wresearch.com/industry-report/vietnam-food-and-beverages-market-outlook)).

### Technological Innovations and Digital Transformation

Technological innovations and digital transformation are playing a crucial role in the growth of Vietnam's F&B industry. Technology platforms have assisted businesses in the F&B industry to easily approach potential customers, reducing fixed costs and exploring many untapped opportunities. With the support of technology, the recovery time for production and business activities of F&B enterprises is also forecasted positively ([Viettonkin Consulting](https://www.viettonkinconsulting.com/fb/the-new-outlook-of-vietnam-food-and-beverage-industry-and-chances-for-investors-post-covid-19/)).

The rise of online food delivery services has also contributed to the sector's growth. Despite adjustments in 2023, with reduced promotions and higher fees, online food delivery remains an integral part of the market. Consumers have adapted, and order sizes have increased ([VNEconomy](https://vneconomy.vn/vietnams-food-and-beverage-industry-poised-for-growth-despite-challenges.htm)).

### Competitive Landscape and Foreign Investment

Vietnam's F&B market presents an irresistible opportunity for investors on a global scale. The country has become a magnet for capital from countries like Korea, Germany, Singapore, and Thailand. The digital transformation revolutionizing dining experiences, emphasizing safety and security, has increased the demand for top-notch food and beverage products ([Vietnam Briefing](https://vietnam.incorp.asia/food-beverage-industry-in-vietnam/)).

However, foreign companies entering Vietnam’s F&B market must navigate fierce competition with locally produced goods and products from other countries. Vietnam is a major producer of agricultural products such as pork, coffee, vegetables, and fruits. The country’s extensive network of free trade agreements (FTAs) has led to an influx of products from partner nations, particularly those in Asia, competing for space on Vietnamese store shelves ([Vietnam Briefing](https://vietnam.incorp.asia/food-beverage-industry-in-vietnam/)).

### Challenges and Opportunities

One of the key challenges for the Vietnam food and beverages market is adapting to changing consumer preferences and demands. Health-conscious consumers are seeking healthier, organic, and locally-sourced food and beverages, which may require significant adjustments in product offerings and supply chains. Additionally, managing food safety and quality standards is critical in light of increasing international trade and export opportunities ([6Wresearch](https://www.6wresearch.com/industry-report/vietnam-food-and-beverages-market-outlook)).

Despite these challenges, the F&B industry in Vietnam demonstrates impressive adaptability and an unwavering appetite for growth. As a nation with rich culinary traditions, it seems poised to become a leading force in the Southeast Asian gastronomic scene ([VNEconomy](https://vneconomy.vn/vietnams-food-and-beverage-industry-poised-for-growth-despite-challenges.htm)).

### Conclusion

Vietnam's F&B market is poised for substantial growth in 2024, driven by strong brand loyalty, strategic expansions, and innovation in product offerings. The stable macroeconomic environment, increasing health trends, technological innovations, and digital transformation are key factors contributing to this growth. While challenges remain, the opportunities for investors and businesses in Vietnam's F&B sector are immense, making it a dynamic and promising market for the future.

This suggests a growing appetite for quality dining experiences. Additionally, spending on coffee has also increased slightly, with 59.5% of customers willing to spend more than VND 41,000 ($1.6) on this activity ([Vietstock](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/03/vietnam-fb-industry-in-2024-continues-growth-with-new-trends-974-550296.htm)).

### Demographic Shifts

#### Middle-Class Expansion

Vietnam's middle class is expanding rapidly, with about 44 million citizens now comprising this segment. This growth in disposable income is helping to expand Vietnam’s F&B industry ([Research in Vietnam](https://www.researchinvietnam.com/insight/the-current-outlook-of-vietnam-fnb-industry)). By 2030, it is estimated that more than half of the Vietnamese population will enter the global middle class, creating more disposable income and fueling consumption ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/asia-pacific/vietnamese-consumers-are-coming-of-age-in-2023-how-businesses-can-stay-ahead)).

#### Urbanization

Urbanization trends are positively impacting the F&B sector's growth. It is predicted that 40% of Vietnamese people will live in cities by 2025, up from around 20% in 1990. Urban residents are more likely to eat out and generally have a greater total spend on food and beverages ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-food-and-beverage-industry-market-trends-demographics-consumer-preferences.html/)).

### Generation Z: The New Consumer Force

Generation Z has emerged as one of the most dominant consumer groups in the market. This segment is not only adventurous but also willing to spend. Gen Z consumers are always looking for something new, highly creative, and are willing to pay for it ([Vietstock](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/03/vietnam-fb-industry-in-2024-continues-growth-with-new-trends-974-550296.htm)). This demographic is driving demand for unique culinary offerings and adventurous dining experiences ([VNEconomy](https://vneconomy.vn/vietnams-food-and-beverage-industry-poised-for-growth-despite-challenges.htm)).

### Health and Quality Consciousness

Health-conscious consumers are seeking healthier, organic, and locally-sourced food and beverages. This trend is driving significant adjustments in product offerings and supply chains ([6WResearch](https://www.6wresearch.com/industry-report/vietnam-food-and-beverages-market-outlook)). Additionally, the increasing popularity of street food among Vietnamese consumers highlights the continued importance of traditional flavors and experiences within the expanding food scene ([VNEconomy](https://vneconomy.vn/vietnams-food-and-beverage-industry-poised-for-growth-despite-challenges.htm)).

### Technological Influence

Technology platforms have assisted businesses in the F&B industry to easily approach potential customers, reducing fixed costs and exploring many untapped opportunities. With the support of technology, the recovery time for production and business activities of F&B enterprises is also forecasted positively ([Viettonkin Consulting](https://www.viettonkinconsulting.com/fb/the-new-outlook-of-vietnam-food-and-beverage-industry-and-chances-for-investors-post-covid-19/)).

### Consumer Spending on Special Occasions

Vietnamese consumers are increasing their spending on dining out by 5-10%. In fact, 14.9% of customers are willing to spend more than VND 100,000 (US$4) on daily dinners, which is 3.5 times higher than in 2022 ([Hanoi Times](https://hanoitimes.vn/vietnam-fb-industry-in-2024-continues-growth-with-new-trends-326464.html)). This indicates a significant shift towards higher spending on quality dining experiences.

### Influence of International Tourists

Tourism indirectly boosts Vietnam's F&B revenues, which grew at an impressive rate by 2023. The largest tourist groups were from South Korea, Europe, and the US, and these tourists spend generously on F&B services in Vietnam ([Vietstock](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/03/vietnam-fb-industry-in-2024-continues-growth-with-new-trends-974-550296.htm)).

### Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape of Vietnam’s FMCG market is characterized by continuous innovation and adaptation. Consumers are becoming more savvy and demanding more from products and brands, so businesses need to consistently enhance customer experiences and be present at every touchpoint ([DMSPro](https://www.dmspro.vn/kantar-vietnam-brand-footprint-2024-which-brands-dominated-the-fmcg-market-in-2023?lang=en)).

## Investment Opportunities and Challenges in Vietnam's F&B Market

### Investment Opportunities

#### Market Growth and Revenue Projections
Vietnam's food and beverage (F&B) market is projected to grow by 10.92% in 2024, reaching a value of over VND 655 trillion (US$26.1 billion) ([Vietstock](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/03/vietnam-fb-industry-in-2024-continues-growth-with-new-trends-974-550296.htm)). This growth is driven by increasing consumer spending, a burgeoning middle class, and a strong recovery post-pandemic. The market is expected to continue its upward trajectory, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.25% between 2023 and 2027, potentially reaching VND 872.9 trillion (US$34.9 billion) by 2027 ([Euromonitor](https://hanoitimes.vn/vietnam-fb-industry-in-2024-continues-growth-with-new-trends-326464.html)).

#### Rising Middle Class and Urbanization
The expanding middle class, which is expected to triple by 2030, is a significant driver of growth in the F&B sector. This demographic shift is accompanied by increased urbanization, with 40% of the population projected to live in cities by 2025 ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-asia/the-new-faces-of-the-vietnamese-consumer)). Urban residents tend to have higher disposable incomes and a greater propensity to dine out, further fueling the F&B market's expansion.

#### Technological Innovations and Digital Transformation
Digital transformation is revolutionizing the F&B industry in Vietnam. Approximately 82.8% of F&B businesses have adopted digital tools, such as point-of-sale management software, to enhance operational efficiency and customer engagement ([VNBIS](https://vnbis.com/news/anticipating-trends-in-vietnams-fnb-industry-in-2024-45/)). The rise of online and omnichannel sales, coupled with robust online marketing strategies, is creating new avenues for growth and customer retention.

#### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
Vietnam's F&B sector is attracting significant foreign investment, with over 50% of franchise deals in the past decade involving F&B businesses ([VNBIS](https://vnbis.com/news/anticipating-trends-in-vietnams-fnb-industry-in-2024-45/)). The country's favorable investment climate, characterized by a stable political environment and cost-competitive labor force, makes it an attractive destination for global investors. Notable investments include Foxconn's US$383 million circuit board plant in Bac Ninh Province and KCN Vietnam's storage facilities in Hai Phong City ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-2024-fdi-landscape-opportunities-incentives-and-emerging-trends.html/)).

#### High-End Dining and Michelin Stars
There is a growing trend for high-end restaurants in Vietnam to compete for Michelin stars. This pursuit of culinary excellence not only enhances the dining experience for local consumers but also positions Vietnam as a prominent player on the international culinary map ([Vietstock](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/03/vietnam-fb-industry-in-2024-continues-growth-with-new-trends-974-550296.htm)). The influx of international tourists, particularly from South Korea, Europe, and the US, further boosts F&B revenues, as these visitors are known for their generous spending on dining experiences.

### Challenges

#### Adapting to Changing Consumer Preferences
One of the key challenges for the F&B market in Vietnam is adapting to the evolving preferences of health-conscious consumers. There is a growing demand for healthier, organic, and locally-sourced food and beverages, which may require significant adjustments in product offerings and supply chains ([6Wresearch](https://www.6wresearch.com/industry-report/vietnam-food-and-beverages-market-outlook)). Additionally, managing food safety and quality standards is critical, especially in light of increasing international trade and export opportunities.

#### Economic Uncertainties and Inflation
Despite the optimistic growth projections, the F&B sector faces economic uncertainties, including inflation and fluctuating consumer purchasing power. In 2023, the economic downturn led to a 3.9% decrease in revenue for F&B businesses, with a higher proportion of businesses reporting a decrease in profit compared to revenue ([VNBIS](https://vnbis.com/news/anticipating-trends-in-vietnams-fnb-industry-in-2024-45/)). These financial pressures necessitate strategic pricing and cost management to maintain profitability.

#### Competition from Domestic and International Players
The F&B market in Vietnam is highly competitive, with numerous domestic and international players vying for market share. Foreign companies entering the market must navigate fierce competition from locally produced goods and products from other countries, particularly those in Asia ([Vietnam Briefing](https://vietnam.incorp.asia/food-beverage-industry-in-vietnam/)). This competitive landscape requires businesses to consistently innovate and enhance customer experiences to stay ahead.

#### Regulatory and Operational Challenges
Navigating the regulatory environment in Vietnam can be complex, particularly for foreign investors. Striking the right balance between competitive pricing strategies and upholding stringent food safety and hygiene standards is paramount. Businesses that can harmonize these factors will be well-positioned to capitalize on the market's growth potential ([Vietnam Briefing](https://vietnam.incorp.asia/food-beverage-industry-in-vietnam/)).

#### Supply Chain and Logistics
Efficient supply chain and logistics management is crucial for the F&B sector, especially given the increasing demand for fresh and high-quality products. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted vulnerabilities in supply chains, prompting businesses to invest in more resilient and flexible logistics solutions ([6Wresearch](https://www.6wresearch.com/industry-report/vietnam-food-and-beverages-market-outlook)). Ensuring timely and efficient delivery of products remains a critical challenge.

### Strategic Recommendations

#### Leveraging Digital Transformation
Businesses should continue to invest in digital transformation to enhance operational efficiency and customer engagement. Utilizing advanced analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) systems can provide valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences, enabling more targeted marketing and personalized experiences ([VNBIS](https://vnbis.com/news/anticipating-trends-in-vietnams-fnb-industry-in-2024-45/)).

#### Focusing on Health and Sustainability
Adapting product offerings to meet the growing demand for healthier and sustainable options can provide a competitive edge. This includes sourcing organic ingredients, reducing the use of artificial additives, and promoting eco-friendly packaging solutions ([6Wresearch](https://www.6wresearch.com/industry-report/vietnam-food-and-beverages-market-outlook)).

#### Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience
Investing in robust supply chain and logistics infrastructure is essential to ensure the timely and efficient delivery of products. This includes diversifying suppliers, adopting advanced inventory management systems, and leveraging technology to optimize logistics operations ([6Wresearch](https://www.6wresearch.com/industry-report/vietnam-food-and-beverages-market-outlook)).

#### Navigating Regulatory Landscape
Foreign investors should seek local expertise to navigate the regulatory environment effectively. This includes understanding local laws and regulations, building relationships with regulatory authorities, and staying informed about any changes that may impact business operations ([Vietnam Briefing](https://vietnam.incorp.asia/food-beverage-industry-in-vietnam/)).

#### Capitalizing on FDI Opportunities
Vietnam's favorable investment climate presents numerous opportunities for foreign investors. Businesses should explore strategic partnerships and joint ventures to leverage local market knowledge and resources. Additionally, taking advantage of government incentives and tax breaks can enhance the viability of investment projects ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-2024-fdi-landscape-opportunities-incentives-and-emerging-trends.html/)).

By addressing these challenges and capitalizing on the abundant opportunities, businesses can position themselves for success in Vietnam's dynamic and rapidly growing F&B market.
